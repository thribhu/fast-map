# How to Get an API Key from Google Cloud Platform

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides API keys that allow you to access various Google services and APIs. Follow the steps below to obtain an API key for your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Google account. If you don't have one, you can create it at [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup).
- Access to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

## Step 1: Create a New Project (if necessary)

If you don't already have a project in the Google Cloud Console, you'll need to create one:

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on the project drop-down and select "New Project."
3. Give your project a name, select your organization (if applicable), and choose a billing account.
4. Click "Create" to create your project.

## Step 2: Enable the APIs

To use an API key, you'll need to enable the APIs you want to access:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard" section.
2. Click the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button.
3. Search for and select the API you want to enable (e.g., "Google Maps JavaScript API").
4. Click "Enable."

Repeat this step for all the APIs you plan to use with your API key.

## Step 3: Create an API Key

Now, let's create an API key:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" section.
2. Click the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button and select "API key."

3. Your new API key will appear on the screen. Click the "Restrict Key" button to configure its restrictions.

## Step 4: Configure API Key Restrictions

API key restrictions enhance security and control over its usage:

1. Under "Key restrictions," select "HTTP referrers (websites)" or "IP addresses" based on your requirements.
2. Add the referrer websites or IP addresses that are allowed to use the API key.
3. Optionally, set a quota limit to prevent abuse.

4. Click the "Save" button to save your key restrictions.

## Step 5: Securely Store Your API Key

API keys should be kept secure. Do not hardcode them in your source code or expose them publicly:

1. Store your API key in a secure location, such as a environment variable or a configuration file.
2. Ensure your application retrieves the key securely during runtime.

## Step 6: Use Your API Key

Now that you have your API key, you can use it to access the enabled APIs in your applications:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&libraries=places"></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the API key you obtained.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully obtained an API key from Google Cloud Platform. You can now integrate it into your applications to access various Google services and APIs.
